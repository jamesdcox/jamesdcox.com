                <p>After working in the Audio Post Production industry in central London for almost 6 years, I decided to take the plunge and pursue a new challenge in what I love to do. I believe my time in this industry has set me up with the key skills required to be a good Web Developer.</p>
                    
                <p>I have taught myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress, PHP, Python and MySQL using online courses and other resources. I am now looking for my first job in the industry.</p>

                <p>This site was set up primarily to showcase what I have learnt so far and to test out new skills that I am learning along the way.</p>
                <p>At certain times some aspects of this site may not work, but please bear with me as Iâ€™m setting it up as I go along. My aim is to have a working blog and email contact form set up soon.</p>
